    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Curry was introduced to Japan during the Meiji era (1868–1912).
         At the time the Indian subcontinent was under British colonial rule. </p>
    <p>Anglo-Indian officers of the Royal Navy brought the spice mix called 
        curry powder to Japan. It was classified as 
        <strong>yōshoku</strong> (Western food) since it came from the West.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
