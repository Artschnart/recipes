    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>It is widely believed that the beginnings of feijoada stem from slavery in Brazil, 
        where slaves put together the scraps of leftover beans and meat from their owners to create a kind of stew. </p>
    <p>However, academics have recently challenged this theory, claiming the origin of feijoada comes from the European settlers.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a strew dish that contain black beans and variety of meats of choices. The dish is cooked in large quantity and difficult to freeze it overnight.</p>
    <p>So, I recommended to cook it for group of people and not for one meal for one person.</p>
    <p>______________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>1 KG</em> of Black Beans</li>

        <li>Pepper</li>

        <li>Butter or Oil <em>(optional)</em></li>
     </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak Black Beans overnight.</li>
        <li>A day later, start boiling bean on cooking pot for 2 hours on medium-low heat. Always close your pot</li>
        <li>While preparing for the bean to be properly cooked, prepare meats by slicing it into medium-seized pieces.</li>
        <li>Around 10 minutes before the bean is cooked, stir-fly meat on pan until its colour is brown</li>
        <p><strong><em>Tips: Although oil or butter isn't necessary in this step; you can use it to improve meat's taste.</em></strong></p>
        <li>After the bean is cooked, use your potato marsher to marsh bean inside the cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Put cooked meat into the cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Seasons strew with salt, pepper, papika, rosemary, and galic powder.</li>
        <li>Stir it slowly...</li>
        <li>Put on bay leaves on the top, set cooking pot's heat to low and wait for 1 hours.</li>
        <li>While waiting, prepare <strong>farofa</strong> by stir cassava flour rapidly on high heat until it started to look like powder.</li>
        <p><strong><em>Note: Farofa is toasted cassava that is used in Brazilian meal.</em></strong></p>
        <p><strong><em>Tip: Cassava may smells like burning flour at first, do not worry, let it cool down which is also very important.</em></strong></p>
        <li>Around 10 minutes for the strew to be finally cooked, stir-fly purple cabbage on pan with salt. Stir it until your liking.</li>
        <li>After strew is cooked, serve it on hot rice alongside stir-fly cabbage; put farofa on strew; and enjoy your meal with spicy mayonnaise sauce!</li>
    </ol>
