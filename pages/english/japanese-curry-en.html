    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Curry was introduced to Japan during the Meiji era (1868–1912).
         At the time the Indian subcontinent was under</p>
    <p>British colonial rule. Anglo-Indian officers of the Royal Navy brought the spice mix called 
        curry powder to Japan.</p>
    <p> It was classified as <strong>yōshoku</strong> (Western food) since it came from the West.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Onions, carrots, and potatoes while beef, pork, for the basic vegetables and chicken are the most popular meat choices.</p>
    <p>To improve the taste even more, I also use "secret" ingredients which is optional but I highly recommended it especially for the bold characters.</p>
