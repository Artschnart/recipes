Simple (terrible) recipes for me, friends, and family.

This recipes will contain both English and Thai languages; 
The language can be changes on the first page. 

The three recipes here are Japanese Curry, a very easy dish that very appetising; Feijoada with rice, a dish that I ate a few week agos as of writing this. It may be not my best recipe but I'm very proud of cooking myself a day after eating it lmao. And lastly, Tom Yum Kung; It is a Thailand national dish although I used to have an perception that the dish is very hard to make but actually it is pretty easy. In fact, it is as easy as cooking and finding ingredients as an "easy comfort food" assuming if you live in Thailand or near Asian grocery store.

As for a website, it is my first website and personal project of my to read my own terrible recipes without thinking hard everytime I need to cook or tell my family what I have came up with, so that mean:

1. Don't expect the food to be great.
2. The website look outdated since I doesn't write any Javascript or CSS here (for now), but atleast it worked and surprising working well on mobile.

Outside of terrible recipes, I also learn many thing of writing a HTML after writing in during my highschool year of 2018, on a notepad.
